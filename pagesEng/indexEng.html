                        Monuments of material culture show that there was a rare prehistoric one on Zlatibor
                        settlements from the Neolithic era, located in dense forests or next to mountain streams and rivers. Remains
                        these cultures, the existence of which is evidenced by ornamented pottery, are found in the dwellings of the then
                        people, caves on steep heights, which today bear the name of the hillfort.

                        The first known inhabitants of Zlatibor were the Illyrians, ie their tribe Partini, which is
                        inhabited the wider Užice area. Throughout this area, except in its central part,
                        they left numerous mounds (prehistoric tombs), for which there is a tradition among the people that they are
                        Greek cemeteries. You can hear this story from older people: “Greeks used to live here, but only one
                        year when it snowed on St. Elijah, they left Zlatibor and died in these small ones
                        cemeteries ”. Remains of their culture - decorated pottery - are found in caves and on steep heights
                        where they lived. Today, these places are called "forts" and there are three of them on Zlatibor (Cajetina,
                        krivorečka, šljivovačka).
                        In the time of the Romans, Zlatibor was part of the Roman province of Dalmatia, they are about that
                        left their own and familiar to the whole of Europe features. For the exploitation of these parts and
                        for military purposes they built a network of famous roads to the surrounding provinces (Mackat -
                        Cajetina hillfort - Uvac river). The Romans left a significant number of tombstones in this area
                        monuments, which mostly date from the 2nd and 3rd centuries. There are also important sites in Kriva Reka and
                        An inn where there are necropolises with tombstones.

                        In the Middle Ages, the Slavs arrived, they left an indelible mark in this area. They also build
                        fortifications and rebuilding forts. There is a fortification on Gradac in Dobroselica, where we can see
                        the remains of the ramparts. Remains of a stone pedestal have been preserved, which was probably used for observation.
                        During the formation of the Serbian state, Zlatibor and the city of Uzice belonged to the prefect Stracimir, and only
                        around 1180, Stevan Nemanja annexed them to his state. In the time of Stevan Nemanja, these
                        mountainous, cattle-breeding areas, together with the entire Užice area, were part of the area
                        known as Stari Vlah. Somewhat later, the Užice region was divided into
                        four parishes: Rujno, Moravica, Lužnica and Montenegro.

                        With the conquest of the Serbian state, the Turks established their rule here as well, dividing Zlatibor into Begerbegluks,
                        chitluks, kadiluks and princesses ruled by Serbian princes. It was Zlatibor during the time of the Turks
                        shared the fate of other Serbian regions, so in turbulent times it was often devastated. Flame
                        The first Serbian uprising, which spread throughout Šumadija in the spring of 1804, also affected
                        Zlatibor. A large number of Zlatibor citizens accepted hidden weapons from Mustafa Pasha's time
                        approached Mihailo Radović, the organizer of the uprising in this area. During the second Serbian uprising on
                        There were no major fights in Zlatibor. General amnesty for the Belgrade pashaluq after negotiations with Porto
                        it included parts of Zlatibor because this area stretched the border between Belgrade and
                        Novi Pazar pashaluq. Until the May coup, the Zlatibor region was in favor of the dynasty
                        Obrenović. King Alexander I Obrenović came to Zlatibor several times, where he was on August 20
                        In 1893, he built a fountain at the source of Kulaševac, which has since been called Kraljeva voda (Đenić,
                        1983).
                        In the first and second Balkan wars, the people of Zlatibor were deployed in the famous IV Infantry Regiment
                        "Stevan Nemanja", who belonged to the Drina Division with which they won a great victory in battles
                        near Kumanovo and Bitola. With the attack of the Bulgarians on Serbia, the IV Regiment "Stevan Nemanja" was involved in the battle
                        on BregalnicaAfter the victory on the Thessaloniki front and liberation, Zlatibor, like the whole of Serbia, entered
                        composition of the kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes and later the kingdom of Yugoslavia. An attack by the Germans
                        occupation forces on April 6, 1941 in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, Zlatibor came under German rule
                        occupation, but soon the flames of the people's liberation struggle brought this area short-lived freedom. From September to November 1941, Zlatibor was part of the "Uzice Republic", the only one
                        free territories in occupied Europe. After the fall of the "Republic of Užice", the Zlatibor region found itself
                        again under German and then Bulgarian occupation followed by material destruction, looting
                        and the shooting of civilians. After the liberation, the people's government was established in all Zlatibor municipalities
                        and Zlatibor became part of the Tito-Uzice region.

                        Zlatibor is home to the most developed type of broken village. They occupy huge territories, sometimes
        5-6 km long, and are divided into hamlets. Villages usually have multiple cemeteries. The houses are made of pine and oak
        trees, called log cabins or osaćanke. They are made with hand tools, but very precisely, and they are set
        on a low stone base. The windows are small in size, and the doors must have two, on the opposite
        walls. There are usually two, although sometimes three rooms in the house. In addition to these living houses,
        one Zlatibor household necessarily had more auxiliary buildings, e.g. dairy, barn, etc.
        The most beautiful and best-preserved specimens of old Zlatibor houses have been moved from all villages throughout Zlatibor
        in Sirogojno, where an open-air ethno-museum was built.
